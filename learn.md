By creating a balloon-popping circuit with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to wire up a circuit
- What transistors are used for
- How to use a push button to control current
- How to use Python code to control the Pi's GPIO pins, to heat up a resistor enough to pop a balloon!

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
- [Use basic materials and tools to create project prototypes](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/manufacture/creator)
