To pop balloons you might usually use a pin. Here you’ll be doing the same, but using a GPIO ‘Pin’ on your Raspberry Pi, not the pin you might be thinking of!

## Requirements

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

### Hardware

- 1 x Solderless breadboard
- 4 x Male-to-female jumper leads
- 7 x Male-to-male jumper leads
- 1 x Push-to-make switch

- 2 x BC635 transistors

### Extras
