To pop balloons you might usually use a pin. Here youâ€™ll be doing the same, but using a GPIO pin on your Raspberry Pi, not the pin you might be thinking of!

## Requirements

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

### Hardware

- 1 x Solderless breadboard
- 4 x Pin-to-socket jumper leads
- 7 x Pin-to-pin jumper leads
- 1 x Push-to-make switch
- 1 x Battery snap
- 2 x 4m core speaker cable (bell wire)
- Some 12R resistors
- 2 x BC635 transistors

### Extras

- Red electrical tape
- Black electrical tape
- String
