title: Safety note

---

In this project, you will heat a 12Ω resistor so that it pops a balloon.

- Do not touch the resistor when the circuit is triggered. It will get VERY hot.
- The transistor may also get hot.
- The balloon will make a loud noise when it pops, which may be distressing for some people.

* 1 x Battery snap
* 1 x Tactile button
  
For each balloon:
* 4 x pin-to-pin jumper leads
* 3 x pin-to-socket jumper leads
* 1 x 2m strip of 2-core speaker cable
* 1 x 12Ω resistor
* 1 x 330Ω resistor
* 1 x BC635 transistor
