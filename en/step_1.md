## What you will learn
By creating a balloon-popping circuit with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to wire up a circuit
- What transistors are used for
- How to use a push button to control current
- How to use Python code to control the Pi's GPIO pins, to heat up a resistor enough to pop a balloon!
