## What next?

Other stuff to try:

- Try changing the balloons' popping order. To do this, just change the order in which the GPIO pin numbers are used.

- Why not try to have the balloons pop when a motion sensor is triggered? You can find out how to use a motion sensor in the [parent detector resource](../rpi-python-parent-detector).
